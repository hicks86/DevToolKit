# Fundamental OOA+D

## Step 1 Collect Requirements
- **Identify** the problems we want to solve
- **Clarify** the functionality needed to solve the problems
- **Document** the important decisions

### Requirements analysis / Collection
- Functional requirements
    - Represent the features
    - Define how to react to input
    - Determine expected behaviour
- Non functional requirements 
    - Not directly related to the features of the system
    - E.g. Performance, Legal, Documentation, Support

 Use short concise sentences/points when writing functional and non-functional requirements. 

 Use [The app/system] must [Do something]

## Step 2 Describe the system
- **Describe** the system from the users point of view
- **Create** wireframes and/or mockups if needed

### Mapping requirements to technical descriptions
- Use Cases
    - Title: Short, descriptive use case title
    - Actor: User, a person or 3rd party system
    - Scenario: Explain how the software works in this scenario
- User Stories
    - As a [type of user] I want to [some goal] so that [some reason]
- Epics
    - Larger user stories that cover a bigger chunk of functionality


## Step 3 Identify the classes

## Step 4 Create diagrams with UML
